## Roadmap

# close bottle

   - mechanical
      1. move hydraulic line to endcap
         - make something for engine to sit on the bench sideways
         - don't stress bladder by running without water
      2. mount motor conroller between bouyancy engine and 
      3. 80/20 mount for main engine tube and bladder
      4. maybe add rudder and wing for full proof of concept.
   
   - electrical
      1. Make teensy program without button
      2. evaluate alternative pump motor controllers
         1. https://products.flightworksinc.com/viewitems/micro-gear-pumps/x-series-brushless-gear-pumps
      3. make cables slide in and out
      4. ensure 16 pin connector allows functional
         1. recharching
         2. data extraction
         3. reprograppimg

   - software
     1. monitor the power of engine cycle for each dive/surface
     2. pump failsafes
        1. check TOF for limits
        2. Check pump rotations
        3. check pressure sensors
        4. perpare for unplugging an instrument while running
        5. handeling sensor failure
     3. see if we need the programming button
     4. calibrate pump flow rate
        1. measure power consumption at diferent speeds
